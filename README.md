# Skola24-worksample
This is a worksample for Skola24.
For convinence both backend and frontend have been placed on same repo.

The backend consists of a CORE REST API (OpenApi 7.0.11) coupled with Entity Frameworks (7.0.14) code first sql database.

Frontend is built upon Vue.js (v3.3.4)

A simple github workflow is running a build and test flow each time a pr or push is made to the main- or development branch.

---
## Installation
Clone the repository.


## - Backend
* **To create the database**: In Visual Studio in Package Manager Console. Default project set to: API.<br>
Apply the migrations and create the database by running the command '`update-database`'.<br>
This will create a local database to access via SQL Server Management Studio.

* **To Access the database:** Connect *Database Engine* with *Windows Authentication* and *Server name:* `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB`

#### Database features
* **Seeding**: The database is set to seed some amount of initial data using the methods in `SeedHelper.cs` <br>
when creating the database for the first time.
* **Dynamic connectionstrings**: When working in local environment, a connectionstring is used to access the local database created. <br>
When in production a different connectionstring will be used automatically.
* **Stored procedure**: When first time creating the database a stored procedure called `GetAbsenceBySchool` is created which is used<br>
in AbsenceService as well as can be tested inside SQL Management Studio.
* **Cors**: Cors is configured for localhost for Vue to be able to access the API.

##### Troubleshooting
* **Cannot find Stored Procedure in SQL Management Studio**: If you can see the stored procedure inside *Database (LocalSkola24) -> Programmability -> Stored Procedures* (`db.GetAbsenceBySchool)`, then refresh Intellisence Cache with `CTRL+SHIFT+R`.

## - Frontend
It is easiest to load the frontend solution in Visual Studio Code. 
- File -> Open Folder -> Frontend (Mark folder and click open)

After opened folder. Run following command in terminal:
* npm install
* npm run build

#### Vue.js features
* **Axios**: Axios setup for enabling API endpoint access.
* **Router**: Vue-router for multipage navigation
* **Bootstrap-icons**: Access icons via bootstrap
* **CSS-grid**: A simple css-grid made for easy and fast layouting

## Running solution
Both Frontend and API can be run separately but in frontend one part ("Fr√•nvarokollen") use the API exclusively. For full experience it's recommendend to run both solutions simultaneously.
* API - Start via Visual studio **https (https://localhost:7285)**
* Vjue - npm run dev (start client server) Open a new browser and type in url **http://localhost:5173/**
